# Lab 3 - Automate app building and deployment using Github Action to Azure Container Apps

## Add Github Action to the repository

## Create Azure Service Principal for Github
### Create the service account
### Add access to ACR and Azure Container Apps
### Add build secret with our service principal credentials

## Add Github Action for the web app

## Add Github Action for the words app

## Summary

We created a limited account that could interact with our docker registry and our container applications. 
After that, we build and deployed our application only when they have some changes.

You have now a full Continuous Deployment Pipeline running into Github !
